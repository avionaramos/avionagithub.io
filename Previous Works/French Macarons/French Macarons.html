            <p>French macarons are delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior. Each individual cookie is known as a
                macaron shell.
                The shells are made without any chemical leaveners and get all of their lift from properly beaten egg
                whites.
                If you follow the recipe carefully, the cookies have a unique nougat-like, chewy texture. They should
                not be hollow.
                You can flavor macarons many ways, but this recipe is for plain macarons. They taste like sweet
                almond—and they’re delicious!
                You can always have fun with different flavorful fillings such as vanilla buttercream, lemon
                buttercream, salted caramel, or chocolate ganache.</p>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. In a fine-mesh sieve, shake flour and
                        confectioners’
                        sugar
                        into a large bowl, breaking up any flour or almond clumps with a fork. Discard solids in
                        sieve
                        (should
                        be no more than 1 tablespoon).</li>
                    <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites and
                        cream of
                        tartar
                        on medium-low speed until frothy, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Increase mixer speed to medium
                        and, with
                        the
                        motor running, slowly add granulated sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time and waiting until
                        dissolved
                        before adding more (this should take 3 to 4 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat until small stiff peaks form when whisk
                        is
                        removed
                        and flipped point-up, 1 to 2 minutes more (do not overmix).</li>
                    <li>Remove bowl from stand mixer and sprinkle half of flour mixture over egg white mixture.
                        Using a
                        flexible
                        rubber spatula, fold in flour mixture in smooth, sweeping strokes, working around sides of
                        bowl with
                        an
                        occasional stroke through the middle, until just incorporated. Add food coloring and
                        remaining flour
                        mixture and continue to fold until incorporated and you can draw a complete figure 8 in the
                        batter
                        without it breaking (do not overmix).</li>
                    <li>Transfer batter to piping bag fitted with 1/2" round tip. Holding piping bag so tip is 1"
                        above and
                        perpendicular to prepared sheet, pipe 1" circles in rows, spacing 1" apart, as macaron will
                        spread.
                        Using both hands, pick up tray about 2" above work surface and lightly bang against surface
                        twice to
                        expel any air pockets. Repeat with second prepared sheet. Using last bits of batter, glue
                        corners of
                        parchment to baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Let rest at room temperature until dry to the touch on top, 15 to 45 minutes, depending on
                        the
                        humidity
                        in the room.</li>
                    <li>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325°. Bake macarons one baking sheet at a time,
                        rotating
                        after 8 minutes, until firm to the touch on top and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool.</li>
                    <li>Arrange half of shells on a clean, dry baking sheet flat side up. Scoop 1/2 teaspoon jam
                        onto flat
                        sides, then close with remaining shells rounded side up.</li>
                    <li>Make Ahead: Shells can be made 1 day ahead. Store in an airtight container at room
                        temperature, or
                        freeze up to 1 month. Filled macarons can be made 5 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight
                        container
                        and
                        refrigerate.</li>
